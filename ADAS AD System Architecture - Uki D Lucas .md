## Motivation

Many startups prototype their ideas on Linux general-purpose computers (laptops, Nvidia Xavier, etc.) to realize, months or years later, that their **prototype has no chance of running in a low-cost, hardware-accelerated, safety-oriented, embedded system** without a major code decoupling and a general re-write. 

The right design from the ground up is the key.

Engineers who switch to the field of **Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS)** and **Automated Driving (AD)** usually have computer perception skills, but generally lack the domain-specific System Architecture experience. 

This situation may change in the next few years as companies like Tesla keep publicizing their designs (see reference #1), but today such designs remain esoteric. 

This text attempts to be a practical guide while referencing **publicly available information** in the reference section at the end.



## What is function of a System Architect?

The System Architect's job is to ensure that the parts of the system, including hardware, peripherals, software, Human-Machine Interfaces (HMI), remote services, as well manufacturing, **delivers a product that functions well as a whole**. The System Architect may not know the details of implementation of a particular component, but should investigate if that component would function well in the final product. The System Architect usually analyses data flows, creates high-level interaction diagrams and system requirements specifications (SRS) from which the user experience (UX) experts, mechanical, electronic and software architects can design their particular domains.

The system architect (often called chief engineer) assures the requirements meet given the **business needs** and a set of **use cases** which represent the desired **user experience (UX)**.

In automotive language, if you build a car, the system specifications will specify:

- the power of the motors used,
- the number of the motors depending of the vehicle type and performance characteristics (AWD, etc.),
- the peak consumption of the power by the motors, 
- the overall power consumption of the motors,
- the expected gearing ratio,
- the heat dissipation management needs for the rotors,
- the battery size and discharge characteristics,
- the power consumption of other electronic components
- and so on

Of course, this is a highly simplified example. 

Please note, that the system architect may not know the internal design of the motor or a battery pack, but the system architecture has to assure the right combination of motors, batteries and gearing ratios to provide a well functioning drivetrain as a whole.



## Design Assumptions



The traditional approach of auto manufacturers, or as they are called in the industry, original equipment manufacturers (OEM), is to provide a **low-cost electronic control unit (ECU) per each feature**. This is to done to enable and insulate model year-to-year upgrades, offer multiple vehicle price-level offerings and use different suppliers.

The recent tendency in the market is to combine many of these into more powerful Domain Controller that host multiple features which are **designed based on the safety level desired**. 

The manufacturers start realizing that **users expect frequent over-the-air (OTA) software upgrades **, which is easier with a single unit. 

It is easier to find place for a single domain controller than 10 different ECUs. 

It is cheaper to manufacture a single unit. 

A single unit draws less current. 

It is also easier to design the cooling which is a big factor in automotive.

In this book I will explore a **Domain Controller that meets safety levels up to L2 of autonomy** and then analyze the design of **L3+ based on the Tesla design** as that is the only one that is publicly available at this time.



## Contributions by the readers

The architects are a very opinionated bunch, every company has different approach to the design, hence I do not expect to hit it off immediately. 

Please consider the following: if you provide me a correction in a constructive format such as "You have written that X is Y, but the X is really Z, based on [URL included]" than I will include the correction and refer to you in the reference by name as the source of new information.

## Updates

I hope you will find this book a good reference. 

If you previously purchased the book on Kindle, I suggest to occasionally delete it from your device and download it again to get the newest version. The date at the beginning should be an indicator.



## Feature-level components of ADAS/AD

There are many subsystems that comprise of ADAS/AD domain. 

Here are some of the examples of features listed from most common to futuristic:

- Surround View (SV)
- Augmented Reality with a console display or windshield-projected heads-up display (HUD) 
- Rear eMirror, Camera Monitoring System (CMS)
- Side eMirrors, Camera Monitoring System (CMS)
- Lane Keep Assist (LKA)
- Pedestrian and large animal detection (perception component)
- Obstacle detection (perception component)
- Emergency Breaking System (EBS)
- Cross-Traffic Alert (CTA)
- Curb Detection (perception component)
- Street-sign detection (perception component)
- Free-Space Detection (perception component)
- Automated Cruise Control (ACC)
- Driver Monitoring System (DMS)
- Occupant Monitoring System (OMS)
- Automated Park Assist (APA)
- Automated Valet Parking (AVP)
- Valet parking - remote summon 
- L2 automated highway driving, driver hands on the steering wheel
- L3 any road autonomy, driver supervision required
- L4 any road autonomy, driver controls provided, driver supervision not required
- L5 full autonomy, no driver controls provided

As you can see the field is very large and constantly growing, this field is a true bonanza for a motivated engineer.







## Software Tools

The book is written using a simple markdown (MD) format using Typora editor. I will use Omnigraffle software to draw the diagrams. I also extensively use GitHub to store my projects.

In smaller organizations, it is quite sufficient to use the combination of **Atlassian JIRA and Confluence** to keep track of **linkage between documentation, requirements and tasks** (project management). Atlassian tools can be easily obtained for as little as $120 per month for organizations up to 20,000 people. (see reference #8)

Atlassian tools are universally used in the industry and generally do not require any introduction. With a bit of planning and learning, you can show the **required traceability, and baseline** documentation for future **ASIL audits**. (see reference #9)

The big organization, on the other hand, love to make things more difficult. They also tend to create a lot of clerical jobs that increase the overhead costs. These people tend to create more bureaucracy which feeds the run-away circle of cost increase.

In the industry, the **Enterprise Architect** (EA) software is commonly used. I know all software is gradually improving, but as of the time of writing, the user EA experience is terrible, reminiscent of circa late 1990s Windows apps. It is based on SVN which continues the theme of technical melancholy. 

EA integration with requirements and documentation is awkward and uni-directional which in my opinion is unacceptable. The licensing is expensive enough that most of the developers never get access to it, or they get a "floating license" which is equivalent of a crew of workers digging a ditch with one shovel. I know there is a newer version of web-based UI of EA, but my employers did not support it, so I do not have an opinion on the improvements.

Much of the documentation and requirements management is done either in Polarion, which is a better one, or in IBM ALM (aka DNG). With DNG I had the displeasure of working daily for over 4 and a half years. 

There is a big opportunity for modern software companies to provide integrated environment for **versioning and traceability between requirements, design documentation, task management and code commits**.



## System Requirements

In the appendix, I will provide a sample of the requirements mentioned in this text.

Below, are few of the guidelines that I recommend based on decades of experience working as an architect.

The complete set of requirements should read like a (technical) book. 

You should be able to export the requirements to a PDF and read them cover to cover to gain the understanding of the system.

The requirements should be easily searchable.

The requirements should not be split into independent modules. I know that a large project can have ten of thousands of requirements, but still, they should be managed as a whole, cover-to-cover. I have seen too many examples of contradictory sets of requirements coming from a single organization where teams are not talking to each other.

The requirements should be written in a clear and easy to understand language, they should leave very little in a way of interpretation. Vague and confusing language indicates lack of understanding of the subject, or lack of care from the architect, in both cases it is a recipe for disaster.

Each requirement has to be treated as an atomic unit without assumptions of prior knowledge. The reason for this is that a developer may not have knowledge of the assumptions that architect made months ago, and which have since changed.

Each requirement should have a unique reference in the project management system (e.g. JIRA) and should be tracked accordingly.

Again, the system architect assures that the system works as a whole. The internals of the components maybe be designed later, but the system requirements should assure that they interface with the system properly.

## Functional Safety (FuSA)



You could write entire book about Functional Safety, but this is not a place for it here. 

However, before starting on the job of architecting the system you have to embrace the concepts.

The ADAS / AD system can have multiple levels of safety, even within that systems, there are often "islands" of certified to be safe and regular, quality-managed (QM), operations.

When humans are driving vehicles, they are responsible for their own safety, for their passengers and others around, not to mention for the property damage. You can give the skipper a rudder and send them off on their way. Once you put the horse in front of that vehicle, the horse takes the commands from the driver and does pulling, turning and stopping. Unruly horses that do not learn how to do it safely do not have long careers and are quickly dispatched to the greener pastures.

Similarly, when you design an ADAS / AD system you take the responsibility for safety.

You have to think which components of your system **control the vehicle**, or could **make the driver make a wrong decision** that could cause harm. 

Even systems that do not control the vehicle such as electronic mirrors, or surround view can cause harm. Once, I was driving a prototype vehicle that had a perfect camera system except it had a couple seconds of latency. It is enough to say, I realized it, once I drove off the curb which, on the screen, was a couple of feet further. No harm was done. 

Another example could be an augmented reality (AR) system that projects on the driver's windshield. Typically, AR does not require safety rating. Let's imagine the AR system runs on the in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) operating system that has the unrelated feature which displays something (e.g. fireworks or disco ball) on the rare occasions (e.g. user's birthday) and it slipped the attention of the quality assurance (QA). It is a far-fetched example, but it drives the need for safety mindset. 

If you are **controlling the vehicle, or potentially distracting the driver** your system has to be evaluated from the safety perspective.

I suggest to **think about safety in reverse order** of the normal flow of information.

At first, think of ADAS / AD module interacting with the vehicle, usually this happens over the CAN bus:

- What happens if the signals are interrupted? You should consider "heart-beat" signals.
- What happens if the signals are stuck in the loop? You should consider a time-stamp in the "heart-beat".
- What happens if module stops sending signals? The vehicle should gracefully transition from the autonomy to a "safe" state. That is quite a challenge in the system where driver is not controlling the vehicle (valet parking, or L5 autonomy).
- How to prevent messages that are erroneous? This could be caused by software problems or cyber-security breach. You should consider the message signature and allowed value ranges.

These are just a few examples, and once you start analyzing your own system, you will be able to come up with a couple hundreds of your own requirements.

Next, you have to take a look inside the ADAS / AD system. 

The logic algorithms that generate **vehicle control signals are usually developed from the ground up in the safe environment**. It is common to see the **"safety island"** running on the dedicated set of the chips that are **isolated from other systems** such as in-vehicle infotainment (IVI). It would be a really bad design if ADAS / AD vehicle control was affected by user turning on media application which causes the chips' utilization spike, voltage supply drop, or communication bandwidth issue.

The "safety island" usually has a separate power management, as safety-certified operating system (OS) such as AUTOSAR (classic) and control software developed in tools such as Simulink.
